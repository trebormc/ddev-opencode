# ddev-opencode

A DDEV add-on that runs [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) in a dedicated container for AI-powered **Drupal** development.

> **Part of [DDEV AI Workspace](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace)** — a modular ecosystem of DDEV add-ons for AI-powered Drupal development. Install the full stack with one command: `ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace`
>
> Created by [Robert Menetray](https://menetray.com) · Sponsored by [DruScan](https://druscan.com)

Agents, rules, and skills for Drupal development are automatically synced from [drupal-ai-agents](https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents) via [ddev-agents-sync](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync). No manual git clone needed.

## Quick Start

The **recommended way** to install this add-on is through the [DDEV AI Workspace](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace), which installs all tools and dependencies with a single command:

```bash
ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace
ddev restart
ddev opencode  # or: ddev oc
```

### Standalone installation

If you only need OpenCode without the rest of the workspace, you can install it individually. This requires familiarity with the DDEV add-on ecosystem and its dependencies:

```bash
ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-opencode
ddev restart
ddev opencode  # or: ddev oc
```

This automatically installs the required dependencies:
- [ddev-agents-sync](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync): auto-syncs AI agents from git
- [ddev-ai-ssh](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-ssh): SSH access to web container
- [ddev-beads](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-beads): task tracking
- [ddev-playwright-mcp](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-playwright-mcp): browser automation

## Prerequisites

- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) >= v1.24.10
- An API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or a LiteLLM proxy)

## Authentication

Run `ddev opencode` and follow the prompts. OpenCode handles authentication natively. No custom commands or manual file editing needed.

Credentials are stored in a shared file on the host (`~/.ddev/opencode/auth.json` by default), so you only need to authenticate **once**. All your DDEV projects share the same credentials automatically.

## Configuration

After installation, environment variables are in `.ddev/.env.opencode`:

```bash
# Shared OpenCode directory for credentials and config.
# Shared across ALL DDEV projects. Change only if you need a custom location.
# Files: auth.json (credentials), config/ (optional shared opencode.json /
# opencode-notifier.json / AGENTS.md overrides + node_modules plugin cache)
HOST_OPENCODE_DIR=${HOME}/.ddev/opencode

# Timezone
TZ=UTC
```

### Agent Configuration

Agents, rules, and skills are automatically synced from [drupal-ai-agents](https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents) via [ddev-agents-sync](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync). No manual setup is needed.

The sync process resolves model tokens (like `${MODEL_CHEAP}`) to OpenCode model names (like `opencode/gpt-5-nano`) using the `.env.agents` file from the agent repository. See [drupal-ai-agents](https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents) for details on model tokens and customization.

To customize which repos are synced, edit `.ddev/.env.agents-sync`:

```bash
# Sync from multiple repos (later repos override earlier ones)
AGENTS_REPOS=https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents.git,https://github.com/your-org/private-agents.git
```

To manually trigger an update: `ddev agents-update`

### Changing agent models

To change which AI models your agents use, override the `.env.agents` file. Create a private git repo with just an `.env.agents` and add it as a second entry:

```bash
AGENTS_REPOS=https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents.git,https://github.com/your-org/my-config.git
```

See [Model Token System](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync#model-token-system) for the full list of tokens and how to customize them.

### Config levels

The container-global `opencode.json` is rebuilt on every container start by DEEP-MERGING a cascade — every level is merged, higher levels win key by key:

| Priority | Location | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | `opencode.json` at the project root | This project only — merged natively by OpenCode on top of the global config |
| 2 | `~/.ddev/opencode/config/opencode.json` on the host | Your config, shared across ALL DDEV projects |
| 3 | Agents volume (synced by `ddev-agents-sync` from the agents repo) | Managed defaults, refreshed by `ddev agents-update` |
| 4 (lowest) | Baked into the image | Basic fallback so the add-on works without `ddev-agents-sync` |

The same cascade applies to `opencode-notifier.json`. All levels use the same merge semantics: objects merge recursively, but arrays and scalars are replaced wholesale — e.g. an `instructions` array at level 2 fully replaces the one below, so you only need to declare the keys you want to change. `~/.ddev/opencode/config/AGENTS.md` overrides the synced orchestrator (markdown is not merged — full replacement). To customize models globally, prefer `.ddev/.env.agents` (see Model Token System above) over a full level-2 config copy.

```

OpenCode communicates with the web container via SSH (`ssh web`), giving it full CLI access to drush, composer, phpunit, phpstan, and any other tool in the web container. SSH keys are auto-generated per project in `.ddev/.agent-ssh-keys/`. Playwright MCP is accessed over HTTP for browser automation and visual testing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ddev opencode` | Launch the OpenCode TUI |
| `ddev oc` | Alias for `ddev opencode` |
| `ddev opencode tui` | Launch TUI (same as above) |
| `ddev opencode tui Fix login bug` | Launch TUI with a custom tab title |
| `ddev opencode shell` | Open a bash shell in the container |
| `ddev opencode <command>` | Run any command in the container |

### Tab title for multi-project workflows

When working on multiple DDEV projects at the same time, it can be hard to tell which terminal belongs to which project. The `tui` subcommand sets the terminal tab title to **`project-name - custom text`**, so you can identify each terminal at a glance.

The project name (`DDEV_SITENAME`) is always included automatically. If you add extra text after `tui`, it appears as a label. Useful for describing the task you are working on in that terminal.

```bash
# Tab title: "mysite - OpenCode"
ddev opencode

# Tab title: "mysite - OpenCode"  (explicit tui, same result)
ddev opencode tui

# Tab title: "mysite - Fix login redirect bug"
ddev opencode tui Fix login redirect bug

# Tab title: "mysite - TASK-42 migrate users"
ddev opencode tui TASK-42 migrate users
```

This way, if you have three terminals open (two projects, two tasks), each tab shows exactly where you are and what you are doing.

### Shell Helpers

Inside the container (via `ddev opencode shell`), these helper functions are available:

| Helper | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `drush` | Run drush commands in the web container |
| `composer` | Run composer in the web container |
| `phpunit` | Run PHPUnit tests in the web container |
| `phpstan` | Run PHPStan analysis in the web container |
| `web-exec` | Execute any command in the web container |
| `web-shell` | Open an interactive shell in the web container |
| `bd` | Run Beads task tracking commands |

## Desktop Notifications (optional)

OpenCode can send desktop notifications when tasks complete or need attention. Notifications are pre-configured via `opencode-notifier.json` (ships with [drupal-ai-agents](https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents)). No setup needed inside the container.

To receive notifications, install the [ai-notify-bridge](https://github.com/trebormc/ai-notify-bridge) on your host (one-time setup):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trebormc/ai-notify-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

If the bridge is not installed or not running, OpenCode works normally. Notification calls fail silently with no impact.

## Multica integration (optional)

[Multica](https://multica.ai) is a managed-agents platform that lets you assign tasks to AI coding agents from a central web UI. This add-on can run the Multica daemon inside the OpenCode container so a self-hosted Multica server can delegate work to OpenCode in any of your DDEV projects.

The Multica binary is always installed in the container, but the daemon only runs when you opt in by setting a token in `~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica`. With no file or an empty token, the integration stays completely dormant and the container behaves exactly as it does without Multica.

### Enable (once, shared with other AI add-ons)

The Multica configuration lives in `~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica`, a directory shared by every Multica-aware DDEV add-on (this one, [ddev-claude-code](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-claude-code), ...). One configuration enables the daemon in all of them — and across every DDEV project on the same host.

```bash
# One-time setup on your host
cp ~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica.example ~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica
$EDITOR ~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica
# Fill in MULTICA_SERVER_URL, MULTICA_APP_URL, MULTICA_TOKEN
```

Then in any DDEV project using a Multica-aware add-on:

```bash
ddev restart
```

The container's entrypoint detects the token, logs in, and starts the daemon in the background. Each container registers as a separate Multica runtime — OpenCode containers show up as `OpenCode DDEV (<project>)` with device name `ddev-<project>-opencode`. Watched workspaces are managed from the Multica UI (the daemon auto-subscribes to all your UI workspaces on login).

### Verify

```bash
ddev opencode shell
multica daemon status
multica agent list
```

You should also see the runtime appear in the Multica UI under "Agent runtimes".

### Disable

Empty the file (or delete it) and `ddev restart`. The entrypoint will skip the Multica section entirely.

```bash
: > ~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica
```

### Token rotation

The Personal Access Token from Multica defaults to a 90-day expiry. When it expires, regenerate it in the Multica UI, update `~/.ddev/multica/.env.multica`, and `ddev restart` each project where you need it.

## Autonomous Execution

For autonomous task execution (overnight runs), see [ddev-ralph](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ralph).

## Uninstallation

```bash
ddev add-on remove ddev-opencode
ddev restart
```
